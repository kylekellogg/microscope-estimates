# Microscope Estimates

Microscope RPG game mechanics ported for use in a tool for agile software development planning.

## Goal

1. Port all but the explicitly role-playing mechanics from Microscope for use in software planning
    1. The mapping of terminology will be as follows:
        - Periods will become Sprints
        - Events will become Features
        - Scenes will become Tasks
    2. The mapping of steps will be as follows:
        1. Big Picture is the idea for the software. This will be left out of the port to allow for teams to work however they best see fit towards accomplishing a cohesive idea.
        2. Bookending History is rather implicit for the software idea. Regardless, all software development has a known starting point and an end goal in mind so this will function as it does in the game.
        3. Palette (adding or banning ingredients) becomes the point in the planning where you determine what technology or technologies to use to accomplish the task.
        4. First Pass and Gameplay will be merged into a single step.
2. (_TBD_) Make the tool allow for multiple users in real time.
